            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <hi>REASONS</hi> against Erecting a Court of Conscience within the City and Liberty of <hi>Westminster.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THIS Bill speciously names Artificers and Labourers, but goes on to subject all Persons of what Degree or Quality soever, to a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment without Bail or Mainprise,</hi> upon his Servants, Shooemakers, or other Tradesman, or even any Hackney-Coachman, Chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or Porter's own Oath, if he do not immediately pay what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he swears to, or if he do not appear upon their summoning of him. And as the Nobility and Gentry are more numerous in <hi>this City of Westminster,</hi> than in any other Place in the Kingdom, it must needs be thought the most unfit and dangerous Place for such a Court of Conscience.</p>
            <p>It is observable, That this intended Court of Conscience, pretending to give Ease to the Subject, doth indeed take away the Difficulty of finding Bail, but the Remedy is worse than the Grievance, for it makes the mean Process like an Execution, a <hi>Commitment without Bail or Mainprise,</hi> which is a Severity not known at the Common-Law, in any Case before Judgment, except in Capital Offences, and yet a Court of Conscience must be Useless without it.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>County Courts,</hi> and <hi>Courts Baron,</hi> there is no Process which touches the Body; the First Process is a <hi>Summons,</hi> and afterwards only <hi>Distress by his Goods.</hi> There is an Ancient Court of this Nature, within the <hi>Liberty of West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> where Remedy for Debts, under 40 <hi>s.</hi> in this way of Proceeding is afforded without Arrests, which is Humbly Conceived to be an Easier way of Proceeding for the Subject in such small Causes, than the Trusting to such an <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> as must be reposed in the intended commissioners of this Court of Conscience; besides the unforeseen Hardships, that must and do constantly attend such Innovated Judicatures, which Infringe upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Laws of this Kingdom, so long, and so happily enjoyed by the People.</p>
            <p>If a Court of Conscience be of that great Use and Benefit, as is pretended, why should it not be generally establish'd in every County, City, and Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in <hi>England?</hi> This possibly is not Attempted, because it would have made all People look farther into it, when it was like to be brought so near Home, and have destroyed the Particular Interests of the Managers of this Bill.</p>
            <p>'Tis Evident in Trials by Juries, (Notwithstanding the great Care of the Judges, and the strict Examinations by the Counsel, who do very often detect Perjuries, tho' very closely concealed) that Perjuries are too frequently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and that such Perjuries, when discovered, appear to be by the Suborna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Party; much greater Hazard must necessarily follow by admitting such Parties to put those Perjuries in Practice themselves, which at this time they meet with so much Difficulty to do, by the present Constitutions of Trials at Law, where by the Ancient Wisdom of our Laws for the Presumption of a Man's being Byassed by his own Interest, 'tis a known and constant Reason to reject any Man's Evidence, if the Matter he is to Prove doth appear to tend to his own Advantage.</p>
